Being alive is all about growth and flexibility. Growth cannot be achieved without adversity.
For this reason I strive to consistently challenge myself throughout my life. I have no desire
to stop learning or to stop changing as an individual. I see in computer science an opportunity to continuously be learning something new. In this field there is no end to the things that can be created, problems to be solved, and realms to be explored. As long as I keep myself mentally and physically healthy, I know that I will always be intellecutally challenged by all that is computer science. When I am not educating myself, you can find me playing guitar, reading novels, spending time with those important to me, rock climbing, and hiking.
