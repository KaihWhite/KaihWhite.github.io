Hello, My name is Kaih White. I am a current student at the Colorado school of Mines
studying Computer Science. I am currently studying algorithms and advanced topics such
as Machine Learning and Deep Machine Learning. I enjoy working in the realms of robotics,
inteligence systems and data science. I thoroughly enjoy working in CS because the field
is brimming with opportunities to help create products that can help and improve the lives
of many people. The challenges that I face with each new problem statement fill me with
enthusiasm as they are just chances for me to learn new things and grow. I am looking for
internships that can give me the opportunity to work on a team and solve real world issues.
If you think that I may be a good fit, please feel free to contact me.
