Welcome to my home page. Take a look around.

My name is Kaih White. I am a current student at Bellevue College who is pursuing a degree
in Computer Science. I am also an instructor working with Coding with Kids to help educate
the next generation of programmers. When it comes to educating myself, I am particularly 
interested in learning about data science and machine learning. The reason I like these topics
is because I see so much potential in solving real world problems with the application of these 
fields.

I am actively seeking challenging opportunities and internships where problem solving and 
collaboration are valued. I am quick to learn new concepts and programs.
